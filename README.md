## FreeCodeCamp Front End API-based Project - Weather App

## User Stories
- [ ] I can see the weather in my current location.
- [ ] I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- [ ] I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Thoughts
This is an old project, it isn't featured anymore at FreeCodeCamp. It was fun at the time, mainly because I had an opportunity to try 3D CSS animations that I was reading about at that time. As usual I tried to distance myself from what other people built, though in this case the result is rather lackluster.
